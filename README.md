## Background

This is a better submission for the Message Board coding test. I did not finish the command parsing entirely, but there is a stub in place that shows where I was going.


The project was built with Visual Studio 2022 and no external packages.

- C#
- .NET 8.0

## Usage

To run the CLI press F5 in Visual Studio 2022.

### Issuing Commands

The CLI will accept input however it does not parse commands fully yet. The commands supported are:
- Follow
- Wall
- Post
- Read

To exit press `CTRL C` then any key.

### Build

`CTRL SHIFT B`
